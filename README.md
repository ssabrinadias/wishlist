### About

    This project is a React application built with Vite. It leverages various tools and libraries for development, testing, and building the application. The architecture is based on a Component-Oriented Architecture (COA), where the primary focus is on building the system from modular and independent components. In this approach, each component represents a specific functionality of the system and interacts with other components in a well-defined manner. This architecture allows for greater modularity, reusability, and maintainability of the system. Components can be developed, tested, and updated separately, promoting a more flexible and scalable system. Changes in one part of the system have a controlled impact on other parts.
